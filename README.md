A toolbox for D&D Dungeon Masters to significally speed up the menial stuff of 5e combat, allowing you to focus more on narration rather than the dull math. 

Now also includes a random map generator using Wave function collapse (WFC), however I cannot provide the art for tiles or decorators I use because they are licensed by a third party. At some point I will upload a step by step instructions how to create your own tileset. 

I or the toolbox is not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast. This is not an official product and they do not endorse it.
